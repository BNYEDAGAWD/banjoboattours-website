# 🚤 Banjo Boat Tours

**"We Love Two Things: 1. Banjos & 2. Boat Tours"**

A deliberately vague, hilariously mysterious website featuring a jacked muscular banjo-playing boat tour guide. No location. No river name. No details. Just biceps, banjos, and boats. Somewhere. Somehow. Someway.

## 🎬 Project Overview
