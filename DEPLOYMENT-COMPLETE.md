**Example**: 10,000 pageviews/month = $80-200/month

### Scaling Projections
| Monthly Pageviews | Expected Revenue (Conservative) | Expected Revenue (Optimized) |
|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | $80 | $200 |
| 50,000 | $400 | $1,000 |
| 100,000 | $800 | $2,000 |
| 500,000 | $4,000 | $10,000+ |

*Actual revenue depends on content niche, traffic quality, geography, and seasonality.*
